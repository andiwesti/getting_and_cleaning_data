For an article that contains a README and references a code book, please review American Community Survey Example.

In a Github repository the README explains the content of the repository and provides an overview of the project contained in the repository. A code book describes the data in a data set, including variable names, descriptions, data formats (i.e. character / numeric), and any special coding conventions (e.g. K = thousands, M = Millions, B = Billions) etc.
